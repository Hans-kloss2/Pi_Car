# Project_A

At Dania Academy in Viborg in our first semester, we got the task to build an Remote Controlled Raspberry Pi 4 car written in Python. As an web interface we are using HTML, CSS and Flask for communication between the Python script and the local website.


## Website
The website is written in pure HTML and CSS. Later on there where added some lines of JS for sensoring the arrow keys of a keyboard input. This made the steering of the Car much easier.

# Here you can see the Website in action

## Requirements

- Python3
    - Flask
    - RPi.GPIO

## Installation
Clone this Repository to the Pi OS and then run the "Website and Flask Code for pi4 car/app.py" file with python3

Both the Pi and the Client (Your PC or Smartphone) has to be on the same network. Then open the ip address of you pi with the port 5010

The IP address of our Pi is 192.168.0.100:5010, yours may be different.
