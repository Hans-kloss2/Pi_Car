# Project_A

At Dania Academy in Viborg, we got the task to build an Remote Controlled Raspberry Pi 4 car written in Python. As an web interface we are using HTML, CSS and Flask for communication between the Python script and the local website.


## Website
The website as already written is written in pure HTML and CSS.
